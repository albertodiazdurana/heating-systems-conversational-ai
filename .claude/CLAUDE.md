## 1. DSM_0.2 Alignment (managed by /dsm-align)

**Project type:** Documentation (DSM 5.0)
**Participation pattern:** Spoke

### Session Transcript Protocol (reinforces inherited protocol)
- Append thinking to `.claude/session-transcript.md` BEFORE acting
- Output summary AFTER completing work
- Conversation text = results only
- Use Session Transcript Delimiter Format for every block:
  <------------Start Thinking / HH:MM------------>
  <------------Start Output / HH:MM------------>
  <------------Start User / HH:MM------------>
- HH:MM is 24-hour local time when the block begins; no end delimiter needed
- Append technique: read last 3 lines, use last non-empty line as anchor.
  NEVER match earlier content for mid-file insertion.

### Pre-Generation Brief Protocol (reinforces inherited protocol)
- Three-gate model: concept (explain) → implementation (diff review) → run (when applicable)
- Each gate requires explicit user approval; gates are independent

### Inbox Lifecycle (reinforces inherited protocol)
- After processing an inbox entry, move it to `_inbox/done/`
- Do not mark entries as "Status: Processed" while keeping them in place

### Punctuation
Use "," instead of "—" for connecting phrases in any language.

### Code Output Standards (reinforces Earn Your Assertions)
- Show actual values: shapes, metrics, counts, paths
- No generic confirmations: avoid "Done!", "Success!", "Data loaded successfully!"
- When uncertain, state the uncertainty; do not guess or fabricate
- Read the relevant source (file, definition, documentation) before answering questions about it; do not answer from partial knowledge
- Let results speak for themselves

### Tool Output Restraint (reinforces Take a Bite)
- Generate only what you can meaningfully process in the next step
- Comprehensive tool reports are reference material, not the analysis itself
- Run tools because the output serves the task, not because the tool is available

### Working Style (reinforces Take a Bite, Critical Thinking)
- Confirm understanding before proceeding
- Be concise in answers
- Do not generate files before providing description and receiving approval

### Cross-Repo Write Safety (reinforces Destructive Action Protocol)
- First write to any path outside this repository in a session requires explicit user confirmation
- Present the content and target path before writing; do not write cross-repo silently
- Subsequent writes to the same cross-repo target in the same session do not need re-confirmation

### Plan Mode for Significant Changes (reinforces Earn Your Assertions)
- Before implementing significant features: explore codebase, identify patterns, present plan
- Do not write or edit files until the plan is approved by the user
- This is a read-only exploration phase, not an implementation phase

### Session Wrap-Up (reinforces Know Your Context)
- When the user says "wrap up" or the session ends, use `/dsm-wrap-up`
- Before wrap-up, cross-reference sprint plan if one exists (verify all deliverables accounted for)
- At minimum: commit pending changes, push to remote, update MEMORY.md
- Create a handoff document if complex work remains pending

## 2. Participation Pattern

Spoke project in the DSM ecosystem. Governance artifacts route through DSM Central.

## 3. Project Type

Documentation project (DSM 5.0). Markdown-only, no notebooks or application code.

## 4. Project Specific

**Project:** Utility Conversational AI
**Objective:** [TO BE DEFINED]
**Structure:** `_reference/` contains sprint plans and user interaction documentation.
